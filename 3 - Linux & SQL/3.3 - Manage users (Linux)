# Linux User Management - Task Guide

## Project Description
A new employee (researcher9) joined the organization, requiring user access management via the Linux command-line interface (Bash shell). Tasks included adding users, managing groups, assigning file ownership, and account removal.

---

## Essential User Management Commands

1. **Add a user to the system**
```
sudo useradd researcher9
```

2. **Assign a user to a specific (primary) group**
```
sudo usermod -g research_team researcher9
```

3. **Delete a user from the system**
```
sudo userdel researcher9
```

4. **Delete the user's group**
```
sudo groupdel researcher9
```
*Note: When a new user is created, a group with the same name is also created. Clean up empty groups after the user is deleted.*

5. **Assign ownership of a file**
```
sudo chown researcher9 /home/researcher2/projects/project_r.txt
```

*All commands require `sudo` privileges ("super user do!").*

## Step-by-Step Task Execution

### Add User and Assign to Group

To add researcher9 and set their primary group:
```
sudo useradd researcher9
sudo usermod -g research_team researcher9
```
Or combine both steps:
```
sudo useradd researcher9 -g research_team
```

---

### Assign File Ownership

Give researcher9 ownership of project files:
```
sudo chown researcher9 /home/researcher2/projects/project_r.txt
```

---

### Add Secondary Group Membership

If researcher9 needs access to both research and sales departments:
```
sudo usermod -a -G sales_team researcher9
```
*The `-a -G` options add secondary group membership without affecting the primary group.*

---

### Delete User and Clean Up

To remove researcher9 after leaving the company:
```
sudo userdel researcher9
sudo groupdel researcher9
```

---

## Summary

- Added new users with `useradd`[file:2]
- Assigned users to primary and secondary groups via `usermod`[file:2]
- Transferred file ownership with `chown`[file:2]
- Deleted users and cleaned up associated groups using `userdel` and `groupdel`[file:2]
```
