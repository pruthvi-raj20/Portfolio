# SQL Filtering - Task Guide

## Project Description
Management requested an investigation into potential security issues and employee computer updates. As a Linux administrator, SQL database queries with filters were used to find critical data and audit logs.

## Security Audit Scenarios and SQL Filters

### 1. Retrieve After Hours Failed Login Attempts

To find failed logins after business hours, use:

```
SELECT *
FROM log_in_attempts
WHERE login_time > '18:00:00'
  AND success = 0;
```

*Finds failed login attempts after 18:00 (after hours). Success column value 0 denotes failure; value 1 denotes success.*[file:3]

---

### 2. Login Attempts on Specific Dates

For suspicious login activity on certain days:

```
SELECT *
FROM log_in_attempts
WHERE login_date = '2022-05-09'
   OR login_date = '2022-05-08';
```

*Outputs login events that occurred on the target dates. Results included 75 login attempts on these two days.*[file:3]

---

### 3. Login Attempts Outside Mexico

To investigate login attempts outside of Mexico:

```
SELECT *
FROM log_in_attempts
WHERE NOT country LIKE 'MEX%';
```

*Lists all login events not attributed to Mexico, including variants like MEX, MEXICO. There were 144 login attempts outside Mexico.*[file:3]

---

### 4. Employees in Marketing - East Building

To filter employee machines by department and office location:

```
SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE department = 'Marketing'
  AND office LIKE 'East%';
```

*Returns employees in Marketing department located in offices prefixed "East". Seven employees matched the criteria.*[file:3]

---

### 5. Employees in Finance or Sales

To find all employees from either Finance or Sales:

```
SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE department = 'Finance'
   OR department = 'Sales';
```

*Lists all employees in those departments. There were 71 matching employees.*[file:3]

---

### 6. Employees Not in IT

To find employees not part of the Information Technology department:

```
SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE NOT department = 'Information Technology';
```

*Filters out all employees that are part of IT. Used for targeted device updates and audit tasks.*[file:3]

## Summary

- SQL queries with logical operators (AND, OR, NOT) and pattern matching (LIKE, %) were used to audit business hours, departmental affiliation, and anomalous logins[file:3]
- Queries supported cybersecurity tasks and organizational audits using real-world filter scenarios[file:3]
