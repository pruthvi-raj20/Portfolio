# Linux File Management - Task Guide

## Project Description
The analyst team tasked me to execute essential organizational tasks on a Linux system using the command-line interface (Bash shell) via Linux Terminal. The tasks included:

1. Find and search files  
2. Create and remove a directory  
3. Move and remove a file  
4. Create and edit a file  

---

## 1. Find and Search Files

### Search for Log Entries
To locate a log file whose lines contain the string "error", use:

```
cd logs
cat server_logs.txt
# or
cat /home/analyst/logs/server_logs.txt
```

Sample output:

```
2022-09-28 13:56:22 error The password is incorrect
2022-09-28 15:56:22 error The username is incorrect
2022-09-28 16:56:22 error The password is incorrect
2022-09-29 13:56:22 error An unexpected error occurred
2022-09-29 15:56:22 error Unauthorized access
2022-09-29 16:56:22 error Unauthorized access
```

To filter lines that match "error":

```
grep error server_logs.txt
```

### Search for Specific Files
To find files whose names contain `Q1` or `access` in the `users` directory:

```
cd /home/analyst/reports/users
ls | grep Q1
ls | grep access
```

Sample output:

```
Q1_access.txt
Q1_added_users.txt
Q1_deleted_users.txt
Q2_access.txt
Q3_access.txt
Q4_access.txt
```

### Search File Contents
To locate the username `jhill` in `Q2_deleted_users.txt`:

```
grep jhill Q2_deleted_users.txt
```

To find who was added to the Human Resources department in Q4:

```
grep "Human Resources" Q4_added_users.txt
```

## 2. Create and Remove a Directory

```

rm tempnotes.txt

# Press CTRL + X to exit, Y to save, Enter to confirm filename.
