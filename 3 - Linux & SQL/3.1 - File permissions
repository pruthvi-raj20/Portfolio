File permissions in Linux
Project description
In this scenario, the research team tasked me to modify the permissions for files and
directories within the project directory. The operating system is Linux, indicating that the
tasks require a command-line interface (Linux Bash shell) approach via Linux Terminal.
Check file and directory details
To begin with, I wrote the command ls to display what directories are available. As the result
goes, the project is the only directory listed. Then, the command ls with the -la displays
file contents as well as the hidden files within the directory of the project. The result shows
there is one hidden file within the project directory. The hidden file naming conventions
start with a period (.), followed by its name. In this case, ”.project_x.txt” is the hidden
file. Other findings include four project files (ends with .txt) and one drafts directory.
