# File Permissions in Linux

## Project Description
In this scenario, the research team tasked me to modify the permissions for files and directories within the project directory. The operating system is Linux, indicating that the tasks require a command-line interface (Linux Bash shell) approach via the Linux Terminal.

## Check File and Directory Details
- Initially, the command `ls` was used to display available directories. The project is the only directory listed.
- The command `ls -la` displays file contents, including hidden files within the project directory.
- There is one hidden file: `.project_x.txt`.
- Other findings: four project files ending with `.txt` and one `drafts` directory.

## Describe the Permissions String
The 10-character string determines file or directory access permissions.

For example:
```
drwxr-xr-x
```
- **1st character (d or -):** `d` indicates a directory (e.g., `drafts`), `-` indicates a regular file.
- **2nd-4th characters:** Read (r), write (w), and execute (x) permissions for the user.
- **5th-7th characters:** Read (r), write (w), and execute (x) permissions for the group.
- **8th-10th characters:** Read (r), write (w), and execute (x) permissions for others (users not in the user group).

## Changing File Permissions (chmod)
To change file permissions, use the `chmod` command.

- `chmod u+(r/w/x) <project_file>`: Add permissions for the user.
- `chmod u-(r/w/x) <project_file>`: Remove permissions for the user.
- `chmod g+(r/w/x) <project_file>`: Add permissions for the group.
- `chmod g-(r/w/x) <project_file>`: Remove permissions for the group.
- `chmod o+(r/w/x) <project_file>`: Add permissions for others.
- `chmod o-(r/w/x) <project_file>`: Remove permissions for others.

### Example Changes Made
- `chmod o-w project_k.txt`: Remove write permissions from others for `project_k.txt`.
- `chmod g-r project_m.txt`: Remove read permissions from the group for `project_m.txt`.

## Changing Permissions on Hidden Files
The `chmod` command can also modify hidden file permissions.
- Example: Remove write permissions for the user and the group, while keeping read permissions for the group:
  ```
  chmod u-w,g-w,g+r .project_x.txt
  ```

## Changing Directory Permissions
Example: 
- `chmod g-x drafts`: Only `researcher2` can access the `drafts` directory.

## Summary
This scenario demonstrates the ability to manage authorization and permissions for files and directories in a Linux environment. The `ls -la` command reveals all files in a directory, and `chmod` changes permissions.
